1.  Introduction

   This memo describes interoperability issues with DMARC and indirect
   mail flows and possible methods for addressing them.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

1.2.  Discussion

   This memo describes interoperability issues with DMARC and indirect
   mail flows and possible methods for addressing them.

2.  List of known interoperability issues

2.1.  Automatic aliasing

   Automatic forwarding is when an original recipient configures their
   target email account (call it displayed_email_account@example.org) to
   forward email to a new destination (alias_email@sample.net).  This is
   done for any number of reasons including a fondness for a new
   interface at @example.net, to consolidate where and how the user
   processes email from many accounts, as part of an "email-for-life"
   service offered by a university or professional association.

   Aliasing poses special challenges if the forwarder modifies the
   message, causing DKIM failure.  In this case, all forwarded-to
   mailbox providers must decide to either reject email falling under a
   DMARC reject policy or to ignore DMARC policy (perhaps with supplying
   an "override" reason of "forwarder" back to the domain owner in DMARC
   aggregate feedback).

   The implementation choice for performing aliasing can affect likely
   changes to the message

3.  IANA Considerations

   No IANA.

4.  Security Considerations

   No Security considerations.
