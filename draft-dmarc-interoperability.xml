      <t>DMARC introduces a mechanism for expressing domain-level policies and preferences for message validation, disposition, and reporting.  The DMARC mechanism can encounter interoperability issues when messages originate from third party sources, are modified in transit, or are forwarded enroute to their final destination.  Collectively these email flows are referred to as indirect email flows.  This document describes interoperability issues between DMARC and indirect email flows.  Possible methods for addressing interoperability issues are presented.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t><xref target="I-D.kucherawy-dmarc-base">DMARC</xref> introduces a mechanism for expressing domain-level policies and preferences for message validation, disposition, and reporting.  DMARC helps combat exact-domain phishing, control an email infrastructure and provide email egress controls. There are enough email receivers checking DMARC and enough email senders with DMARC p=reject policy for its impact on email flows to be significant. </t>
      <t>The DMARC mechanism can encounter several different types of interoperability problems when messages are processed in some way, either by mailing list software or by simple forwarders. This is known collectively as indirect email flows.  In some of these cases, message content is modified as a result.</t> 
      <t>The next section describes interoperability issues between DMARC and indirect email flows.  These issues are first described in the context of configuration behavior that DMARC requires from underlying authentication technology, and then described as they appear in context of the Internet Mail Architecture <xref target="RFC5598"/>.</t>
      <t>Lastly, possible methods for addressing interoperability issues are presented.  There are often multiple ways to address any given interoperability issue.  Whereas this document strives to be comprehensive in its review, it should not be treated as complete.</t>
      <section title="Document Conventions">
        <t>Notation regarding structured fields is taken from <xref target="RFC5598"/>.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Causes of Interoperability Issues">
      <section title="Identifier Alignment">
        <t>A fundamental aspect of message source validation is what is being validated.  Each of the underlying mechanisms that DMARC uses (<xref target="RFC6376">DKIM</xref> or <xref target="RFC7208">SPF</xref>) takes a different approach. Therefore, the <xref target="I-D.kucherawy-dmarc-base">DMARC</xref> mechanism attempts to predictably specify the domain that will be used for its purposes (reporting/message disposition).  In the DMARC specification, this step is referred to as Identifier Alignment to the Orgnizational Domain(s) present in the 5322.From <xref target="RFC5322" />.</t> 
        <t>DMARC's Identifier Alignment requirement causes a number of distinct interoperability issues with indirect email flows. The central role that the 5322.From domain plays in Identifier Alignment can cause issue with email Originators (Section 2.2.1 of <xref target="RFC5598" />) that otherwise have no administrative relationship to a message's 5322.From domain. The presence of multiple domains within a single 5322.From header can further complicate DMARC processing.</t>
        <t>SPF provides authenticated domain identifiers based on either the 5321.MailFrom <xref target="RFC5321" /> domain or, if the 5321.MailFrom address is absent (as in the case of "bounces"), the domain found in the HELO/EHLO SMTP command.  Achieving Identifier Alignment between the 5322.From domain and the SPF-provided authenticated domain identifier effectively requires the 5321.MailFrom domain to be related to the 5322.From domain. An email operator seeking to transmit DMARC compliant email faces the issue of configuring and maintaining envelope addresses that previously did not require any relationship to the content of emitted email.</t>
        <t>DKIM provides a cryptographic means for a domain to be associated with a particular message.  It is strictly not required that the domain be contained in the 5322.From field.  Section 3.1.4.1 of <xref target="I-D.kucherawy-dmarc-base"/> recognizes this fact by providing both strict and relaxed processing modes. Both of these modes present certain challenges to operators. For purposes of identifier alignment, strict alignment will cause messages with valid DKIM signatures to fail, and relaxed alignment may allow a bad actor to sign a message that might mistakenly be considered trustworthy. </t>
        <t> In addition, DKIM allows for the possibility of multiple valid signatures.  DMARC requires that so long as one of those signatures aligns and verifies, the message is considered to have passed.  However, experience has shown that some implementations have difficulty processing multiple signatures.  The impact on DMARC processing is clear: if an implementation cannot process multiple DKIM signatures it may lead to perfectly valid messages being flagged as not authentic. </t>
      </section>
      <section title="Message Forwarding">
        <t>Message forwarding is a generic concept encapsulating a variety of behaviors.  <xref target="IMA_DMARC" /> describes forwarding behavior as it relates to the components of the Internet Mail Architecture.</t>
        <t>DMARC offers both strict and relaxed modes of testing SPF identity alignment.  Relaxed mode poses the risk that a connecting server will properly validate its SPF identity while offering messages that are not in any sense authentic. In the case of strict mode, the domain of the 5321.MailFrom or 5321.HELO/EHLO must match that of the 5322.From.  Because forwarders generally do not modify the 5322.From, this test will fail.  Thus a DMARC implementation must rely on DKIM, if available, in these cases. </t>
      </section>
      <section title="Message Modification">
        <t>Modification of email content invalidates most DKIM signatures.  While DKIM provides a length flag so that content can be appended, in practice, particularly with MIME-encoded messages, a mailing list processor will do more than append (See Section 5.3 of <xref target="RFC5598"/> for details). </t> 
      </section>
      <section title="Implications of Identity Alignment Failure">
        <t>As described in <xref target="IMA_DMARC" />, email processing contexts where both forwarding and message modification are present are common in some use cases. In such contexts where reliable authenticated domain identifiers are not present the DMARC mechanism may produce unwanted results.</t>
    </section>
      </section>
    <section title="Internet Mail Architecture, DMARC, and Indirect Email Flows" anchor="IMA_DMARC">
      <t>This section describes components within the Internet Mail Architecture <xref target="RFC5598" /> where interoperability issues between DMARC and indirect email flows can be found.</t>
      <section title="Message Handling System">
        <t>Section 4 of <xref target="RFC5598" /> describes six basic components that fulfill the purpose of the Message Handling System (MHS):
           <list style="symbols">
             <t>Message</t>
             <t>Message User Agent (MUA)</t>
             <t>Message Submission Agent (MSA)</t>
             <t>Message Transfer Agent (MTA)</t>
             <t>Message Delivery Agent (MDA)</t>
             <t>Message Store (MS)</t>
           </list>
           Of these components MSA, MTA, and MDA are discussed in relation to interoperability with DMARC.</t>
        <t>A Mediator is a special class of MUA that is given special consideration in this section due to the unique issues Mediators face when attempting to interoperate with DMARC.</t>
        <section title="Message Submission Agent">
          <t>An MSA accepts messages submitted by a Message User Agent (MUA) and enforces the policies of the hosting ADministrative Management Domain (ADMD) and the requirements of Internet standards.</t>
          <t>MSAs are split into two sub-components:
            <list style="symbols">
              <t>Author-focused MSA functions (aMSA)</t>
              <t>MHS-focused MSA functions (hMSA)</t>
            </list></t>
          <t>MSA interoperability issues with DMARC begin when an aMSA accepts a message where the 5322.From header contains a domain that is outside of the ADMD of the MSA.  The ADMD will almost certainly not be capable of sending email that yields authenticated domain identifiers related to the domain found in the 5322.From header.  Examples of this issue include "forward-to-friend" functionality commonly found on news/article websites or "send-as" functionality present on some MUAs.</t>
          <t>When an hMSA takes responsibility for transit of a message containing a domain in the 5322.From header that is outside of the hMSA's ADMD, the hMSA faces DMARC interoperability issues if the domain publishes a DMARC policy of "quarantine" or "reject".  These issues are marked by an inherent difficulty in modifying the domain present in a message's 5322.From header.  Examples of this issue include:
             <list style="symbols">
               <t>Pseudo-open relays - a residential ISP that allows its customers to relay any domains through its infrastructure.</t>
               <t>Embedded devices - cable/dsl modems, firewalls, wireless access points that send email using hardcoded domains.</t>
               <t>Email service providers - ESPs that service customers that are using freemail services where the freemail service publishes a DMARC "reject" policy.</t>
               <t>Calendaring software - an invited member of an event modifies the event causing calendaring software to emit an update that appears to come from the creator of the event.</t>
             </list></t>
        </section>
        <section title="Message Transfer Agent">
          <t>MTAs relay a message until the message reaches a destination MDA.</t>
          <section title="Message Encoding">
            <t>An MTA may change the message encoding. For instance it may convert 8bits mail sections to quoted-printable 7bits sections, or just change the character set from US-ASCII to ISO-8859-4. Such transformations invalidate any present DKIM signature.</t>
          </section>
          <section title="Anti-spam">
            <t>To keep its reputation, an MTA that transfers message,
            may block or otherwise removal harmful content
            from messages that are likely to be unwanted by the next
            MTA. Any such modifications would invalidate a DKIM signature.
	    </t>
          </section>
          <section title="Email Address Internationalization">
            <t>A DMARC interoperability issue arises in the context of Email Address Internationalization <xref target="RFC6530" />.  <xref target="RFC6854" /> allows group syntax in the 5322.From header during the transition period to SMTPUTF8.  In the case where an EAI/SMTPUTF8-aware MTA relays a message to a non-aware MTA, the EAI/SMTPUTF8-aware MTA may transform the 5322.From header of the message to include group syntax that allows the non-aware MTA to process the email.</t>
            <t>This transformation modifies the content of the message and will invalide any DKIM signatures and possibly remove the ability for the DMARC mechanism to receive an autheticated domain identifier from a DKIM module.</t>
          </section>
        </section>
        <section title="Message Delivery Agent">
          <t>The MDA transfers a message from the MHS to a mailbox.  Like the MSA, the MDA consists of two sub-components:
             <list style="symbols">
               <t>MHS-focused MDA functions (hMDA)</t>
               <t>Recipient-focused MDA functions (rMDA)</t>
             </list></t>
          <t>Both the hMDA and the rMDA can redirect a message to an alternative address.  DMARC interoperability issues related to redirecting of messages are described in <xref target="mediators" />.</t>
          <t>SIEVE <xref target="RFC5228" /> functionality often lives in the rMDA sub-component and can cause DMARC interoperability issues. The SIEVE 'addheader' and 'deleteheader' filtering actions can modify messages and invalidate DKIM signatures, removing DKIM- supplied authenticated domain identifiers as inputs to the DMARC mechanism.</t>
        </section>
      </section>
      <section title="Mediators" anchor="mediators">
        <t>Descriptions of Mediators are largely imported from <xref target="RFC5598" />.</t>
        <t>Mediators forward messages through a re-posting process.  Mediators share some functionality with basic MTA relaying, but have greater flexibility in both addressing and content modifications.</t>
        <t>DMARC interoperability issues are prevalent within the context of Mediators, as Mediators represent a class of transformations that mirror the concept of "indirect email flows".</t>
        <section title="Alias">
          <t>An Alias is a simple re-addressing facility that provides one or more new Internet Mail addresses, rather than a single, internal one.  A message continues through the transfer service for delivery to one or more alternate addresses.</t>
          <t>Aliases can be implemented by mailbox-level forwarding (e.g. through "dot-forwarding") or SIEVE-level forwarding (through the SIEVE 'redirect' action).  When an Alias preserves message content, DKIM signatures may remain valid.  However, Aliases extend the delivery path beyond SPF's ability to grant authorization.</t>
          <t>Examples of Aliasing include:
             <list style="symbols">
               <t>Forwarding email between freemail providers to try different interfaces while maintaining an original email address.</t>
               <t>Consolidating many email addresses into a single acccount to centralize processing.</t>
               <t>Services that provides "activity based", "role based" or "temporary" email addresses such as universities and professional associations.</t>
             </list></t>
        </section>
        <section title="ReSender">
          <t>ReSenders "splice" a message's addressing information to connect the Author of the original message with the Recipient of the new message.  The new Recipient sees the message as being from the original Author, even if the Mediator adds commentary.</t>
          <t>ReSenders introduce DMARC interoperability issues as content modification invalidates DKIM signatures.  SPF's ability to grant authorization is removed as the new Recipient receives the message from the Mediator.</t>
          <t>Without an ability to produce authenticated domain identifiers relevant to the Author's 5322.From domain using either DKIM or SPF, the new Recipient has almost no chance of successfully applying the DMARC mechanism.</t>
          <t>Examples of ReSenders include MUA-level forwarding by resending a message to a new recipient or by forwarding a message "inline" to a new recipient (this does not include forwarding a message "as an attachment").  An additional example comes in the form of calendering software that allows a meeting attendee (not the meeting organizer) to modify the content of an invite causing the invitations to be appear to be reissued from the meeting organizer.</t>
        </section>
        <section title="Mailing Lists">
          <t>A Mailing List receives messages as an explicit addressee and then re-posts them to a list of subscribed members.  The Mailing List performs a task that can be viewed as an elaboration of the ReSender.</t>
          <t>Mailing Lists share the same DMARC interoperability issues as ReSenders, plus the following:
             <list style="symbols">
               <t>Subscribed members may not receive email from members that post using domains that publish a DMARC "p=reject" policy.</t>
               <t>Mailing Lists may interpret DMARC-related email rejection as an inability to deliver email to the recipients that are checking and enforcing DMARC policy.  This processing may cause subscribed members to be suspended or removed from the Mailing List.</t>
             </list></t>
        </section>
        <section title="Gateways">
          <t>A Gateway performs the basic routing and transfer work of message relaying, but it also is permitted to modify content, structure, address, or attributes as needed to send the message into a messaging environment that operates under different standards or potentially incompatible policies.</t>
          <t>Gateways share the same DMARC interoperability issues as ReSenders.</t>
          <t>Gateway-level forwarding can introduce DMARC interoperability issues if the Gateway is configured to rewrite the message to map between recipient domains.  For example, an acquisition may lead the acquiring company to decide to decommission the acquired companies domains by rewriting messages to use the domain of the acquiring company.</t>
        </section>
        <section title="Boundary Filter">
          <t>To enforce security boundaries, organizations can subject messages to analysis for conformance with its safety policies.  A filter might alter the content to render it safe, such as by removing content deemed unacceptable.</t>
          <t>Boundary Filters share the same DMARC interoperability issues as ReSenders.</t>
          <t>Examples of Boundary Filters include:
             <list style="symbols">
               <t>"MX backup" services.</t>
               <t>Antispam services that operate by acting as a domain's primary MX, often inserting footers such as "Scanned by Company".</t>
               <t>Email servers that that perform filtering functions.</t>
             </list></t>
        </section>
      </section>
      <section title="Combinations">
        <t>The causes of indirect email flows can be combined.  For example, a university student may subscribe to a mailing list (using his university email address) while this university email address is configured to forward all emails to a freemail provider where a more permanent email address for this student exists. </t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Possible Solutions to Interoperability Issues">
      <t>Solutions to interoperability issues between DMARC and indirect email flows vary from improving of underlying processors, such as proper handling multiple DKIM signatures, to more radical approaches to the messaging architecture.  This section decribes possible ways to address interoperability issues.</t> 
      <t> Through external knowledge it may be possible to determinine that the DMARC mechanism cannot be applied to a particular message because modification and/or forwarding is to be expected through the normal course of operations for a given sender.  This is known as an "override" and is not discussed further in this memo. </t>
      <section title="Identifier Alignment">
        <t>Various proposals have been submitted to provide either some form of transitive trust between an email sender, a realy and an email receiver, or to allow a modified version of DKIM to survive light transformation to the message.

            <t>The postmaster will choose the solution best for its users but really to avoid DMARC being rendered useless (and DKIM and other anti-spam techniques) the real solution is to upgrade your MTAs, if you want to do DMARC, to support EAI so that the group syntax in the 5322.From is not needed for interoperability issues during transition. </t>

              <t>One common mitigation policy is to configure the MLM to alter the RFC5322.From field to use the domain of the MLM. Since most list subscribers prefer to know the identity of the author of the original message, typically this information may be provided in the display name part of the RFC5322.From field. This display name needs to be carefully crafted as to not collide with the original display name of the author, nor contain something that looks like an email address or domain name. These modification may to some extent defeats the purpose of DMARC itself. It may make it difficult to ensure that users of all email clients can easily reply to author, list, or all using the email client features provided for that purpose. Use of "Reply-To" can alleviate this problem depending if the mailing list is configured to reply-to-list, reply-to-author or reply-to-fixed-address. </t>
              <t>Another common mitigation policy is to configure the MLM to "wrap" the message in a MIME message/rfc822 part. This completely bypasses the DMARC policy in clients that allow reading the part as a message. Many email clients (as of August 2014) have difficulty reading such messages. </t>
              <t>Finally a less common mitigation policy, is to configure the MLM to not modify the message so that the DKIM signature remains valid.</t>
              <t>To alleviate unsubscribes to the mailing list due to the messages bouncing because of DMARC, the MLM needs to not act on bounces due to Message Authentication issues. Correctly interpreting Extended SMTP error messages is useful in this case.</t>

      <section title="Getting More Radical: Requiring new communication paths between MUA and the message store">
	<t>In practice a number of operators are using strict mode in DMARC in order to avoid receiving new and innovative forms of unwanted and unauthentic mail through systems purporting to be mailing list handlers.  The receiving ADMD has no knowledge of which lists the user has subscribed to and which they have not.  One avenue of exploration would be for the user to authorize mailing lists as proxies for authentication, at which point the receiving ADMD would be vesting some trust in the mailing list service.  The creators of DKIM foresaw precisely this possibility at the time by not tightly binding any semantics to the 5322.From.  Some experimental work has taken place in this area, as mentioned above.  Additional work might examine a new communication path to the user to authorize third party signatures.</t> </section>

    <!-- There are 2 ways to insert reference entries from the citation libraries:
     1. define an ENTITY at the top, and use "ampersand character"RFC2629; here (as shown)
     2. simply use a PI "less than character"?rfc include="reference.RFC.2119.xml"?> here
        (for I-Ds: include="reference.I-D.narten-iana-considerations-rfc2434bis.xml")

     Both are cited textually in the same manner: by using xref elements.
     If you use the PI option, xml2rfc will, by default, try to find included files in the same
     directory as the including file. You can also define the XML_LIBRARY environment variable
     with a value containing a set of directories to search.  These can be either in the local
     filing system or remote ones accessed by http (http://domain/dir/... ).-->
